Header and Navigation nearing completion. Steps left to work on:

1. Header needs to be a carousel of images. Three or more to cycle over time.
2. Navigation needs to be sticky once it reaches the top of the screen. Then unsticky once you scroll back up towards the top.
3. Need to add in a default logo box just for the sake of having it. Wont have a real logo currently.

Among the things completed today, we added in the animations for the header text and box on page load, added in the basic navigation as well as hover associated text.

Initial Setup:
This project I will be following a SASS video training for,
though I will not be following the video exactly. I plan on working and
creating a PSD that I downloaded from:

https://365psd.com/psd/focal-resume-psd-theme-54071

The goal of the project is to complete something website related. I currently
have another project in the works that is heavier on JS(number guess game), this
will be a heavier focus on CSS and HTML. I shall work on these projects concurrently
as my JS project will require some CSS especially, though the logic is my focus
as of now.

Theme: I am going to be using a "Space" Photography theme for this static website.
I will be using dummy text where possible and probably will only likely be using
"real" text in regards to photos taken from stock photos and alt text for those
photos.
